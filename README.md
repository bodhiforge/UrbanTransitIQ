# UrbanTransitIQ

## Overview
This analysis explores the public transit system in Metro Vancouver using GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data and geographical information. The study focuses on transit coverage, service distribution, and different modes of transportation across the region.

## Data Integration
- Successful combination of multiple data sources:
  - GTFS transit data
  - Administrative boundaries
  - Stop locations
  - Route shapes

## Key Findings
### 1. Transit Coverage by Community

Transit service extends across multiple municipalities within Metro Vancouver
Core urban areas show higher density of transit stops
Suburban areas maintain consistent but lower-density coverage
